                    <strong>Accidents as major problems to face</strong></h3>
                <h4 class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-7">&nbsp; &nbsp; Accidents occur quite often in our surroundings, right? in our house, playground, roads, etc. Here in this article, we are here to talk about road accidents, what are they, how do they happen and why are people still ignoring this problem. At the end we will also provide a solution to this problem! Yes, you heard it absolutely right! A solution to a problem like this! we will also talk about Carbon Emissions (CO2) and also provide way and methods to reduce or just stop it. So, let's start right away!<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; So, let's start with what are road accidents. I guess it is needless to say this as I assume most of you have already witnessed them or experienced them, but, it is my duty to say about it to those who don't know about it. A road traffic accident (RTA) is any injury due to crashes originating from, terminating with or involving a vehicle partially or fully on a public road. Now, that you know what a road accident is, let's see how does it happen. Nowadays, people are too busy to even lift their heads up and all of them are after time! Nobody seems to have even 1 minute to spare and due to this they always in a hurry, which mainly causes accidents. They don't have time cause they don't know how to manage time. For such people, all I would like to say is, first learn to manage time and then get on to the road, if you can't, its better for you to work from home or use public transport. There are many other causes of accidents too. In some areas, there is no traffic police and no traffic controls. In recent years, a lot has improved and the government has taken many steps to ensure that there is no hindrance in controlling traffic from their side. I guess you have understood how and why accidents happen. That said, let's see some things about carbon emissions (CO2).<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carbon Emission is increasing global warming and effecting the global climate. For reducing this, we all need to shift from petrol and diesel cars to electric cars. If not electric, at least shift from BS4 to BS6 variants. I know its hard, but we need to do it. But the poor who cannot afford it, wont be able to do anything about it and on that part, we fail. To succeed in this part itself, more attention should be paid to human resource development, so that people can get more educated, earn more money and contribute to the nation that uplifted them and gave them a chance to live with their heads up.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Finally, coming to the great surprise! I am a kind of person who likes to keep the most favourite at the end to enjoy it the most! So I kept this surprise at the end. Let me reveal the surprise. The surprise of reducing road accidents to a great extent is our "Death Saver" software, which is absolutely free! The software locates vehicles near by and indicates it by drawing a red border around it. Red is a dark color. Even if the drivers head is facing downwards at a small angle, when the red border around a vehicle suddenly appears, he will get alert in accordance with human instincts and then drive at a distance from the vehicle preventing accidents. This software is revolutionary! Use it to save yourself, your family, your friends and the people close to your heart! I wouldn't make the mistake of saying that it will stop accidents completely, but it will surely reduce accidents in huge scale. So, one can download the software from the download button below. Due to some technical issues, the file wont be accessible in an exe form. We are heartly sorry for this. So, to run it, kindly install python from <a href="python.org">here</a> and also install opencv by pasting this: "" in the terminal (cmd). Then run the installed python file to enjoy!<br></h4>
